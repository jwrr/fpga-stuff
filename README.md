VHDL Examples
-------------

VHDL is a language for programming FPGAs.  This repo has a growing collection 
of examples.

More docs and examples are on [Github Pages][home].

Cocotb
------

The first few examples use a simple vhdl testbench.  For more advanced
testing two popular VHDL test frameworks are [OSSVM][osvvm] and [UVVM][uvvm].

But, for me, this is the year of Python.  So I'll use [Cocotb][cocotb].
