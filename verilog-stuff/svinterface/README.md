SVinterface.py
==============

STATUS
------

Very early Work in Progress. It parses an interface and generates a python
dictionary.  Next step are to parse a module, find the interfaces and
convert them into input/output/inout/reg/wire.


What is it, what will it be?
-------------------------------

The goal is to convert systemverilog interfaces into verilog-2005 and be a
preprocessor for simulation and synthesis tools that support verilog, but do
not yet support systemverilog.
